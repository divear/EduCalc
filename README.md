# EduPage grade average calculator

For some reason edupage doesn't have this build in, so I made this small script to calculate the average if you received a new grade.

# How do I use this?

1. Clone this repo, create a `.env` file in root directory and add:

```env
USERNAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password

```

2. Run it with:

```sh
cargo run

```

## How does this work?

It just scrapes the site and calculates it.
